# Formatting

Coding style and formatting are pretty arbitrary, but a project is much easier to follow if everyone uses the same style. Individuals may not agree with every aspect of the formatting rules, and some of the rules may take some getting used to, but it is important that all project contributors follow the style rules so that they can all read and understand everyone's code easily.

To help you format code correctly, we've created a [settings file for emacs](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/google-c-style.el).


## Line Length

	Each line of text in your code should be at most 80 characters long.
We recognize that this rule is controversial, but so much existing code already adheres to it, and we feel that consistency is important.

__Pros__:

Those who favor this rule argue that it is rude to force them to resize their windows and there is no need for anything longer. Some folks are used to having several code windows side-by-side, and thus don't have room to widen their windows in any case. People set up their work environment assuming a particular maximum window width, and 80 columns has been the traditional standard. Why change it?

__Cons__:
Proponents of change argue that a wider line can make code more readable. The 80-column limit is an hidebound throwback to 1960s mainframes; modern equipment has wide screens that can easily show longer lines.

__Decision__:

80 characters is the maximum.

Exception: if a comment line contains an example command or a literal URL longer than 80 characters, that line may be longer than 80 characters for ease of cut and paste.

Exception: an #include statement with a long path may exceed 80 columns. Try to avoid situations where this becomes necessary.

Exception: you needn't be concerned about `header guards` that exceed the maximum length.


## Non-ASCII Characters

	Non-ASCII characters should be rare, and must use UTF-8 formatting.

You shouldn't hard-code user-facing text in source, even English, so use of non-ASCII characters should be rare. However, in certain cases it is appropriate to include such words in your code. For example, if your code parses data files from foreign sources, it may be appropriate to hard-code the non-ASCII string(s) used in those data files as delimiters. More commonly, unittest code (which does not need to be localized) might contain non-ASCII strings. In such cases, you should use UTF-8, since that is an encoding understood by most tools able to handle more than just ASCII.

Hex encoding is also OK, and encouraged where it enhances readability â€” for example, `"\xEF\xBB\xBF"`, or, even more simply, `u8"\uFEFF"`, is the Unicode zero-width no-break space character, which would be invisible if included in the source as straight UTF-8.

Use the u8 prefix to guarantee that a string literal containing `\uXXXX` escape sequences is encoded as UTF-8. Do not use it for strings containing non-ASCII characters encoded as UTF-8, because that will produce incorrect output if the compiler does not interpret the source file as UTF-8.

You shouldn't use the C++11 `char16_t` and `char32_t` character types, since they're for non-UTF-8 text. For similar reasons you also shouldn't use `wchar_t` (unless you're writing code that interacts with the Windows API, which uses `wchar_t` extensively).


## Spaces vs. Tabs

	Use only spaces, and indent 2 spaces at a time.

We use spaces for indentation. Do not use tabs in your code. You should set your editor to emit spaces when you hit the tab key.


## Function Declarations and Definitions

	Return type on the same line as function name, parameters on the same line if they fit.
Functions look like this:

```cpp
ReturnType ClassName::FunctionName(Type par_name1, Type par_name2) {
  DoSomething();
  ...
}
```

If you have too much text to fit on one line:

```cpp
ReturnType ClassName::ReallyLongFunctionName(Type par_name1, Type par_name2,
                                             Type par_name3) {
  DoSomething();
  ...
}
```

or if you cannot fit even the first parameter:

```cpp
ReturnType LongClassName::ReallyReallyReallyLongFunctionName(
    Type par_name1,  // 4 space indent
    Type par_name2,
    Type par_name3) {
  DoSomething();  // 2 space indent
  ...
}
```

Some points to note:

* If you cannot fit the return type and the function name on a single line, break between them.
* If you break after the return type of a function definition, do not indent.
* The open parenthesis is always on the same line as the function name.
* There is never a space between the function name and the open parenthesis.
* There is never a space between the parentheses and the parameters.
* The open curly brace is always at the end of the same line as the last parameter.
* The close curly brace is either on the last line by itself or (if other style rules permit) on the same line as the open curly brace.
* There should be a space between the close parenthesis and the open curly brace.
* All parameters should be named, with identical names in the declaration and implementation.
* All parameters should be aligned if possible.
* Default indentation is 2 spaces.
* Wrapped parameters have a 4 space indent.

If some parameters are unused, comment out the variable name in the function definition:

```cpp
// Always have named parameters in interfaces.
class Shape {
 public:
  virtual void Rotate(double radians) = 0;
}

// Always have named parameters in the declaration.
class Circle : public Shape {
 public:
  virtual void Rotate(double radians);
}
```


```cpp
// Comment out unused named parameters in definitions.
void Circle::Rotate(double /*radians*/) {}
// Bad - if someone wants to implement later, it's not clear what the
// variable means.
void Circle::Rotate(double) {}
```

## Function Calls

	On one line if it fits; otherwise, wrap arguments at the parenthesis.

Function calls have the following format:

```cpp
bool retval = DoSomething(argument1, argument2, argument3);
```

If the arguments do not all fit on one line, they should be broken up onto multiple lines, with each subsequent line aligned with the first argument. Do not add spaces after the open paren or before the close paren:

```cpp
bool retval = DoSomething(averyveryveryverylongargument1,
                          argument2, argument3);
```

If the function has many arguments, consider having one per line if this makes the code more readable:

```cpp
bool retval = DoSomething(argument1,
                          argument2,
                          argument3,
                          argument4);
```

Arguments may optionally all be placed on subsequent lines, with one line per argument:

```cpp
if (...) {
  ...
  ...
  if (...) {
    DoSomething(
        argument1,  // 4 space indent
        argument2,
        argument3,
        argument4);
  }
```

In particular, this should be done if the function signature is so long that it cannot fit within the maximum [line length].


## Braced Initializer Lists

	Format a braced list exactly like you would format a function call in its place.

If the braced list follows a name (e.g. a type or variable name), format as if the `{}` were the parentheses of a function call with that name. If there is no name, assume a zero-length name.

```cpp
// Examples of braced init list on a single line.
return {foo, bar};
functioncall({foo, bar});
pair<int, int> p{foo, bar};

// When you have to wrap.
SomeFunction(
    {"assume a zero-length name before {"},
    some_other_function_parameter);
SomeType variable{
    some, other, values,
    {"assume a zero-length name before {"},
    SomeOtherType{
        "Very long string requiring the surrounding breaks.",
        some, other values},
    SomeOtherType{"Slightly shorter string",
                  some, other, values}};
SomeType variable{
    "This is too long to fit all in one line"};
MyType m = {  // Here, you could also break before {.
    superlongvariablename1,
    superlongvariablename2,
    {short, interior, list},
    {interiorwrappinglist,
     interiorwrappinglist2}};
```


## Conditionals

	Prefer no spaces inside parentheses. The else keyword belongs on a new line.
There are two acceptable formats for a basic conditional statement. One includes spaces between the parentheses and the condition, and one does not.

The most common form is without spaces. Either is fine, but be consistent. If you are modifying a file, use the format that is already present. If you are writing new code, use the format that the other files in that directory or project use. If in doubt and you have no personal preference, do not add the spaces.

```cpp
if (condition) {  // no spaces inside parentheses
  ...  // 2 space indent.
} else if (...) {  // The else goes on the same line as the closing brace.
  ...
} else {
  ...
}
```

If you prefer you may add spaces inside the parentheses:

```cpp
if ( condition ) {  // spaces inside parentheses - rare
  ...  // 2 space indent.
} else {  // The else goes on the same line as the closing brace.
  ...
}
```

Note that in all cases you must have a space between the if and the open parenthesis. You must also have a space between the close parenthesis and the curly brace, if you're using one.

```cpp
if(condition)     // Bad - space missing after IF.
if (condition){   // Bad - space missing before {.
if(condition){    // Doubly bad.
if (condition) {  // Good - proper space after IF and before {.
```

Short conditional statements may be written on one line if this enhances readability. You may use this only when the line is brief and the statement does not use the else clause.

```cpp
if (x == kFoo) return new Foo();
if (x == kBar) return new Bar();
```

This is not allowed when the if statement has an else:

```cpp
// Not allowed - IF statement on one line when there is an ELSE clause
if (x) DoThis();
else DoThat();
```

In general, curly braces are not required for single-line statements, but they are allowed if you like them; conditional or loop statements with complex conditions or statements may be more readable with curly braces. Some projects require that an if must always always have an accompanying brace.

```cpp
if (condition)
  DoSomething();  // 2 space indent.

if (condition) {
  DoSomething();  // 2 space indent.
}
```

However, if one part of an if-else statement uses curly braces, the other part must too:

```cpp
// Not allowed - curly on IF but not ELSE
if (condition) {
  foo;
} else
  bar;

// Not allowed - curly on ELSE but not IF
if (condition)
  foo;
else {
  bar;
}
```
<hr/>

```cpp
// Curly braces around both IF and ELSE required because
// one of the clauses used braces.
if (condition) {
  foo;
} else {
  bar;
}
```

## Loops and Switch Statements

	Switch statements may use braces for blocks. Annotate non-trivial fall-through between cases. Empty loop bodies should use `{}` or `continue`.

`cas`e blocks in `switch` statements can have curly braces or not, depending on your preference. If you do include curly braces they should be placed as shown below.

If not conditional on an enumerated value, `switch` statements should always have a `default` case (in the case of an enumerated value, the compiler will warn you if any values are not handled). If the `default` case should never execute, simply `assert`:

```cpp
switch (var) {
  case 0: {  // 2 space indent
    ...      // 4 space indent
    break;
  }
  case 1: {
    ...
    break;
  }
  default: {
    assert(false);
  }
}
```

Empty loop bodies should use {} or continue, but not a single semicolon.

```cpp
while (condition) {
  // Repeat test until it returns false.
}
for (int i = 0; i < kSomeNumber; ++i) {}  // Good - empty body.
while (condition) continue;  // Good - continue indicates no logic.
```
<hr/>

```cpp
while (condition);  // Bad - looks like part of do/while loop.
```

## Pointer and Reference Expressions

	No spaces around period or arrow. Pointer operators do not have trailing spaces.
The following are examples of correctly-formatted pointer and reference expressions:

```cpp
x = *p;
p = &x;
x = r.y;
x = r->y;
```

Note that:

* There are no spaces around the period or arrow when accessing a member.
* Pointer operators have no space after the * or &.

When declaring a pointer variable or argument, you may place the asterisk adjacent to either the type or to the variable name:

```cpp
// These are fine, space preceding.
char *c;
const string &str;

// These are fine, space following.
char* c;    // but remember to do "char* c, *d, *e, ...;"!
const string& str;
```
<hr/>

```cpp
char * c;  // Bad - spaces on both sides of *
const string & str;  // Bad - spaces on both sides of &
```

You should do this consistently within a single file, so, when modifying an existing file, use the style in that file.

## Boolean Expressions

	When you have a boolean expression that is longer than the standard line length, be consistent in how you break up the lines.

In this example, the logical AND operator is always at the end of the lines:

```cpp
if (this_one_thing > this_other_thing &&
    a_third_thing == a_fourth_thing &&
    yet_another && last_one) {
  ...
}
```

Note that when the code wraps in this example, both of the && logical AND operators are at the end of the line. This is more common in Google code, though wrapping all operators at the beginning of the line is also allowed. Feel free to insert extra parentheses judiciously because they can be very helpful in increasing readability when used appropriately. Also note that you should always use the punctuation operators, such as && and ~, rather than the word operators, such as and and compl.


## Return Values

	Do not needlessly surround the return expression with parentheses.

Use parentheses in return expr; only where you would use them in x = expr;.

```cpp
return result;                  // No parentheses in the simple case.
return (some_long_condition &&  // Parentheses ok to make a complex
        another_condition);     //     expression more readable.
```

<hr/>

```cpp
return (value);                // You wouldn't write var = (value);
return(result);                // return is not a function!
```

## Variable and Array Initialization

	Your choice of `=`, `()`, or `{}`.

You may choose between `=`, `()`, and `{}`; the following are all correct:

```cpp
int x = 3;
int x(3);
int x{3};
string name = "Some Name";
string name("Some Name");
string name{"Some Name"};
```

Be careful when using the `{}` on a type that takes an `initializer_list` in one of its constructors. The `{}` syntax prefers the initializer_list constructor whenever possible. To get the non- `initializer\_list`constructor, use `()`.

```cpp
vector<int> v(100, 1);  // A vector of 100 1s.
vector<int> v{100, 1};  // A vector of 100, 1.
```

Also, the brace form prevents narrowing of integral types. This can prevent some types of programming errors.

```cpp
int pi(3.14);  // OK -- pi == 3.
int pi{3.14};  // Compile error: narrowing conversion.
```

## Preprocessor Directives

	The hash mark that starts a preprocessor directive should always be at the beginning of the line.

Even when preprocessor directives are within the body of indented code, the directives should start at the beginning of the line.

```cpp
// Good - directives at beginning of line
  if (lopsided_score) {
#if DISASTER_PENDING      // Correct -- Starts at beginning of line
    DropEverything();
# if NOTIFY               // OK but not required -- Spaces after #
    NotifyClient();
# endif
#endif
    BackToNormal();
  }
```

<hr/>

```cpp
// Bad - indented directives
  if (lopsided_score) {
    #if DISASTER_PENDING  // Wrong!  The "#if" should be at beginning of line
    DropEverything();
    #endif                // Wrong!  Do not indent "#endif"
    BackToNormal();
  }
```


## Class Format

	Sections in public, protected and private order, each indented one space.

The basic format for a class declaration (lacking the comments, see `Class Comments` for a discussion of what comments are needed) is:

```cpp
class MyClass : public OtherClass {
 public:      // Note the 1 space indent!
  MyClass();  // Regular 2 space indent.
  explicit MyClass(int var);
  ~MyClass() {}

  void SomeFunction();
  void SomeFunctionThatDoesNothing() {
  }

  void set_some_var(int var) { some_var_ = var; }
  int some_var() const { return some_var_; }

 private:
  bool SomeInternalFunction();

  int some_var_;
  int some_other_var_;
  DISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN(MyClass);
};
```

Things to note:

* Any base class name should be on the same line as the subclass name, subject to the 80-column limit.
* The `public:`, `protected:`, and `private:` keywords should be indented one space.
* Except for the first instance, these keywords should be preceded by a blank line. This rule is optional in small classes.
* Do not leave a blank line after these keywords.
* The public section should be first, followed by the `protected` and finally the `private` section.
* See `Declaration Order` for rules on ordering declarations within each of these sections.


## Constructor Initializer Lists

	Constructor initializer lists can be all on one line or with subsequent lines indented four spaces.

There are two acceptable formats for initializer lists:

```cpp
// When it all fits on one line:
MyClass::MyClass(int var) : some_var_(var), some_other_var_(var + 1) {}
```

or

```cpp
// When it requires multiple lines, indent 4 spaces, putting the colon on
// the first initializer line:
MyClass::MyClass(int var)
    : some_var_(var),             // 4 space indent
      some_other_var_(var + 1) {  // lined up
  ...
  DoSomething();
  ...
}
```

## Namespace Formatting

	The contents of namespaces are not indented.

Namespaces do not add an extra level of indentation. For example, use:

```cpp
namespace {

void foo() {  // Correct.  No extra indentation within namespace.
  ...
}

}  // namespace
```

Do not indent within a namespace:

```cpp
namespace {

  // Wrong.  Indented when it should not be.
  void foo() {
    ...
  }

}  // namespace
```

When declaring nested namespaces, put each namespace on its own line.

```cpp
namespace foo {
namespace bar {
```


## Horizontal Whitespace

	Use of horizontal whitespace depends on location. Never put trailing whitespace at the end of a line.

### General

```cpp
void f(bool b) {  // Open braces should always have a space before them.
  ...
int i = 0;  // Semicolons usually have no space before them.
int x[] = { 0 };  // Spaces inside braces for braced-init-list are
int x[] = {0};    // optional.  If you use them, put them on both sides!
// Spaces around the colon in inheritance and initializer lists.
class Foo : public Bar {
 public:
  // For inline function implementations, put spaces between the braces
  // and the implementation itself.
  Foo(int b) : Bar(), baz_(b) {}  // No spaces inside empty braces.
  void Reset() { baz_ = 0; }  // Spaces separating braces from implementation.
  ...
```

Adding trailing whitespace can cause extra work for others editing the same file, when they merge, as can removing existing trailing whitespace. So: Don't introduce trailing whitespace. Remove it if you're already changing that line, or do it in a separate clean-up operation (preferably when no-one else is working on the file).


### Loops and Conditionals

```cpp
if (b) {          // Space after the keyword in conditions and loops.
} else {          // Spaces around else.
}
while (test) {}   // There is usually no space inside parentheses.
switch (i) {
for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
switch ( i ) {    // Loops and conditions may have spaces inside
if ( test ) {     // parentheses, but this is rare.  Be consistent.
for ( int i = 0; i < 5; ++i ) {
for ( ; i < 5 ; ++i) {  // For loops always have a space after the
  ...                   // semicolon, and may have a space before the
                        // semicolon.
for (auto x : counts) {  // Range-based for loops always have a
  ...                    // space before and after the colon.
}
switch (i) {
  case 1:         // No space before colon in a switch case.
    ...
  case 2: break;  // Use a space after a colon if there's code after it.
```

### Operators

```cpp
x = 0;              // Assignment operators always have spaces around
                    // them.
x = -5;             // No spaces separating unary operators and their
++x;                // arguments.
if (x && !y)
  ...
v = w * x + y / z;  // Binary operators usually have spaces around them,
v = w*x + y/z;      // but it's okay to remove spaces around factors.
v = w * (x + z);    // Parentheses should have no spaces inside them.
```

### Templates and Casts

```cpp
vector<string> x;           // No spaces inside the angle
y = static_cast<char*>(x);  // brackets (< and >), before
                            // <, or between >( in a cast.
vector<char *> x;           // Spaces between type and pointer are
                            // okay, but be consistent.
set<list<string>> x;        // Permitted in C++11 code.
set<list<string> > x;       // C++03 required a space in > >.
set< list<string> > x;      // You may optionally use
                            // symmetric spacing in < <.
```


## Vertical Whitespace

	Minimize use of vertical whitespace.

This is more a principle than a rule: don't use blank lines when you don't have to. In particular, don't put more than one or two blank lines between functions, resist starting functions with a blank line, don't end functions with a blank line, and be discriminating with your use of blank lines inside functions.

The basic principle is: The more code that fits on one screen, the easier it is to follow and understand the control flow of the program. Of course, readability can suffer from code being too dense as well as too spread out, so use your judgement. But in general, minimize use of vertical whitespace.

Some rules of thumb to help when blank lines may be useful:

* Blank lines at the beginning or end of a function very rarely help readability.
* Blank lines inside a chain of if-else blocks may well help readability.
